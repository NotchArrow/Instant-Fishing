# About
A simple mod made to make fishing more powerful and useful in the game. Instant catches make fishing a more viable source for XP and Enchanted Books. Random loot tables open the mod to be used for challenges and minigames.

This mod can be installed clientside and used on singleplayer or serverside without the players needing to install it.
